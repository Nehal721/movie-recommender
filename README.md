🎬 Movie Recommendation System...

    A content-based movie recommendation system using vectorization on a dataset of 5000 movies.

📌 Overview

    This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Vectorization to recommend similar movies based on user input. It processes metadata such as genres, actors, and descriptions to find the most relevant movie suggestions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
    Web Framework: Flask (or Streamlit for UI)

Libraries Used:
    pandas – Data processing
    numpy – Mathematical computations
    sklearn – Vectorization & ML models
    nltk – Text preprocessing
📂 Dataset

    The dataset consists of 5000 movies with key attributes like title, genre, cast, and descriptions.
    Preprocessing includes handling missing data, feature extraction, and vectorization.
🚀 How It Works

🔹 Code Summary
        Your movie recommendation system follows these steps:

    Data Loading & Preprocessing

        Reads the dataset and extracts relevant columns (movie title, genre, overview, etc.).
        Handles missing values using imputation techniques.
        Combines multiple features into a single text column for better analysis.
    Text Processing & Feature Engineering

        Tokenization and removal of stopwords using nltk.
        Stemming applied to words to reduce redundancy.

    Vectorization & Similarity Computation

        Uses TF-IDF or CountVectorizer to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors.
        Computes cosine similarity to measure how close two movies are.
    Recommendation System

        Accepts a movie name as input and fetches the top N most similar movies.
        Uses sorted similarity scores to rank the recommendations.

✅ Enter a movie name, and get a list of recommended movies!
    Input: Inception
    Top 5 Recommended Movies:
    1. Interstellar
    2. The Prestige
    3. Shutter Island
    4. The Matrix
    5. Memento

🎨 Web Design & UI

    Along with the core recommendation system, a responsive web page is being designed to provide a user-friendly interface. The UI will be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for a seamless experience.

📌 Future Enhancements
    ✅ Hybrid Recommendations (Collaborative + Content-based)
    ✅ UI Integration (Web or Desktop App)
    ✅ Deep Learning Models for better recommendations
